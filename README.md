# Automated Generic EDA as LLM Feed

This project provides an **Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** pipeline that generates detailed insights into a dataset using natural language outputs. The pipeline leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interpret and present statistical summaries, visualizations, and key findings from structured datasets.

## Features

- **Data Summary**: Automatically generates descriptive statistics for numerical, categorical, and mixed datasets.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies potential outliers using statistical methods.
- **Data Cleaning Suggestions**: Highlights missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, and suggests preprocessing steps.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Computes correlation metrics and highlights significant relationships between variables.
- **Automated Visualizations**: Generates relevant visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to support the findings.
- **LLM Integration**: Translates technical EDA results into human-readable summaries and business insights.

## Architecture

1. **Input**: Upload a structured dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. **EDA Processing**:
   - Data profiling
   - Statistical computations
   - Visualization generation
3. **LLM Feed**: Processed EDA results are converted into natural language summaries using an LLM.
4. **Output**: Detailed EDA report as text, images, or PDF.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-generic-eda-llm-feed.git
   cd automated-generic-eda-llm-feed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up your LLM API credentials (e.g., OpenAI API or other providers). Update config.yaml or environment variables with your API key.
